## Notes

This is always a hit. 

Charlie said he loved it but recommended smaller water chestnuts when I made it for Thanksgiving 2022. So for Christmas, I asked Tim to help out with the chopping. He texted Charlie:

Tim: "So what is the proper size of water chestnuts in spinach dip? Halves? Quarters? I'm the sous chef."
Charlie (30 minutes later): "Lol I couldn't tell you by heart, it's more of a feeling."
Tim: "Well, I got a feeling it's quarters because it's too late for anything else."
Charlie: Haha.
