## Notes

Deb's Notes: I made this often when the kids were little. Rather than assemble the casserole, I freeze the shells individually so we can reheat them in small batches.

Rather than use jarred marinara sauce (which is fine), sometimes I make my own, like this one from Cooks Illustrated: [Quick Tomato Sauce](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated/recipes/4728-quick-tomato-sauce?incode=MCSCD00L0&ref=new_search_experience_3)
