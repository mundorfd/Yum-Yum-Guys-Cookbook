# Maman's Cheese Soufflé From Jacques Pépin

## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus additional to butter a 5- to 6-cup gratin dish
- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 5 extra-large eggs (or 6 large ones)
- 2 1/2 cups grated Swiss cheese, preferably Gruyère (about 6 ounces), plus three more optional slices for garnish (roughly 2-inch by 3-inch)
- 3 tablespoons minced chives

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 400°F. Butter a 5- to 6-cup gratin dish (we used the 12.75 x 9” Staub Medium Cast Iron Oval Roasting Dish from the Food52 Shop), sprinkle the bottom and sides with half the Parmesan, and set it aside. Melt the 6 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, then add the flour and mix it in well with a whisk. Cook for 10 seconds, add the cold milk in one stroke and mix it in with a whisk. Keep stirring with the whisk until the mixture thickens and comes to a strong boil, about 2 minutes. It should be thick and smooth. Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt and pepper.
2. Break the eggs into a bowl and beat well with a fork. After about 10 minutes, the white sauce should be cool enough to proceed. Moving quickly, add the eggs, cheese and the chives to the sauce, and mix well to combine. Pour into the buttered gratin dish and cook immediately, or set aside until ready to cook. If setting aside for a few hours, the soufflé can remain outside at room temperature. If assembling a day ahead, refrigerate and bring back to room temperature before baking.
3. Sprinkle the surface with the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan and arrange the 3 slices of Gruyère in a circle in the center, if using. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until puffy and well browned on top. Although it will stay inflated for quite awhile, it is best served immediately.

Deb's Notes: Delicious and impressive. It was much easier to make than I thought it would be.
