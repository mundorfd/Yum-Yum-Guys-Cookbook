# I Caught Crabs on My Honeymoon Spicy Crab Dip

## Description

Chuck and I were both still in school when we got married and couldn't afford a lavish honeymoon. Plus we both loved the Oregon coast, and fishing (foreshadowing for our later move to Tillamook). When comparing notes on honeymoon adventures with the other Mundorffs one day, I blurted out "We caught crabs on our honeymoon!" before having a chance to realize what I was saying. We've been now married 19 years, and I have yet to live that one down.

## Ingredients

2 whole Dungeness crabs -- shelled
1 C sharp cheddar cheese -- shredded fine
½ C mayonnaise
¼ C green pepper -- minced
2 green onions -- finely chopped
1 tsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt
½ tsp dry mustard
½ tsp ground red pepper
french bread

## Directions

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients; stir until well blended. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours. Serve chilled with French bread or crackers.

Deb M. I think from a Leisure Arts Cookbook - but it has definately evolved. Canned crab was the first ingredient to go.
