# Lemon Rice

## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown rice
- 1 3/4 cups coconut water — plus a few additional tablespoons as needed (or swap unsalted vegetable or chicken broth or stock, though I highly recommend trying the coconut water version at least once!)
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt — plus additional to taste
- Zest and juice of 1 medium lemon — about 1/4 cup juice
- 2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley — or any herbs you love

## Directions

1. Rinse and drain the rice. Combine the rice, coconut water, salt, and coconut oil in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
2. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to a low simmer, and cook for 45 minutes. Check a few times, especially towards the end as the rice cooks. If at any point it looks like it is becoming dry or sticking, splash in additional coconut water as needed.
3. Remove from the heat. Add the lemon zest and lemon juice and then fluff with a fork to combine. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley. Enjoy warm.

## Notes

Delicious!!!! I made this using white rice and following the instructions on the white rice package. Basically, I just made white rice in coconut water and then after it was done cooking I stirred in some lemon juice and lemon rind. The result was such a nice creamy flavorful rice pretty much elevated to what I know as cooked rice.
