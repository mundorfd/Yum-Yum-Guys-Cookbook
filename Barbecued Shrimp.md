# Barbecued Shrimp

## Ingredients

### Shrimp

- 4 lbs. shrimp raw, heads and shell
- 8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks)
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 10 cloves garlic minced
- 3 bay leaves
- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon Essence (recipe follows)
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary
- 2 teaspoons fresh oregano
- 1 teaspoon crushed whole peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 lemons, cut in half and their juice
- 1 large loaf crusty French bread

### Essence (Emeril's Creole Seasoning)

- 1 tbsp paprika.
- 1 tbsp sea salt.
- 1 tbsp garlic powder.
- 1 1/2 tsp onion powder.
- 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano.
- 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme.
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper.
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper (if you like it spicy, use more)

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse the shrimp under cold running water and let drain. Spread in 1 layer in a large roasting pan or baking dish. Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients, except the shrimp and bread, and stir to mix well. Remove from the heat and pour over the shrimp. Bake in the oven until the shrimp are pink and cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the shrimp from drying out. Remove from the oven and pour into a large serving bowl or individual bowls to be peeled and eaten at tableside, with hot French bread for dunking in the sauce.
