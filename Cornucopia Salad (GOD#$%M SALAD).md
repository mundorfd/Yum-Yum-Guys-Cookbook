# Cornucopia Salad (GOD#$%M SALAD)

## Description

This is my absolute favorite salad. When Darcy first shared it with me. I made it over and over again until the fourth or fifth time in a couple of weeks. Chuck complained and asked if I was going to make that "goddamm salad" again. So we don't call it Cornucopia salad anymore,Â·but still love it :-)
