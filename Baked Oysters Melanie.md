# Baked Oysters Melanie

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup champagne
- 1 cup cream
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 2 tablespoons butter at room temperature,
- lemon for garnish
- fresh dill for garnish
- pinch salt
- 24 oysters shucked with nectar
- 4 cups rock salt
- 12 ounces brie cut into 24 slices,
- 2 teaspoons fresh dill chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400.
2. Combine champagne and cream in a saucepan. Reduce over medium heat to about 1 cup. Blend the flour into the butter and add mixture a little at a time to the champagne cream, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Season with a pinch of salt and the chopped dill.
3. Remove the sauce from the heat and reserve.
4. Heat oysters and their nectar in a saute pan until the edges begin to curl.
5. Spread half the rock salt on a baking sheet and arrange the oyster shells on the salt. The salt will help distribute the heat and keep the oysters from tipping over.
6. Put an oyster in each of the shells, spoon 2 teaspoons of sauce over each and top with a slice of brie.
7. Bake oysters for 3 to 5 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted and a little browned.
8. Arrange oysters on the serving plates and garnish with lemon and fresh dill sprigs. You'll have the better part of a bottle of champagne left over. Drink it with the oysters. They're made for each other. 

## Notes

Deb's notes: Just because we are more likely to have it on hand, we have been using a combination of mozzarella and Parmesan instead of the brie. We steam the oysters slightly before shucking.
