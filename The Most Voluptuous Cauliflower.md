# The Most Voluptuous Cauliflower

## Ingredients

- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
- 1 1/2 cups grated Gruyere cheese
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place about half an inch of water in a pot fitted with a steaming basket, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add cauliflower, and steam until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. In a medium heavy saucepan over low heat, heat the butter, cream and 1 cup of the Gruyere until bubbling. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the cauliflower, and heat for 2 minutes.
3. In a shallow 2-quart baking dish, spread the cauliflower, and sprinkle with the remaining Gruyere. Season with salt and pepper. Dot with mascarpone and sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 minute. Increase heat to broil, or remove to separate broiler about 6 inches from heating element. Broil until surface is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately.

## Notes

Deb's Note: I loved this - used sour cream instead of marscapone. Not sure what cheeses  - ones I had. Doubled ingredients bus used one 2lb bag of cauliflower florets from Costco.
