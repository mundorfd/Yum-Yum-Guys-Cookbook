## Category

- Appetizers

## Ingredients

### Shrimp

- 2 pounds shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound) ½ teaspoon salt

### Cocktail Sauce

- 1 cup ketchup
- ¼ cup prepared horseradish
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Directions

For the shrimp: Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 140°F/60°C in 7-quart container.

Using kitchen shears or sharp paring knife, cut through shell and meat of shrimp and devein but do not remove shell. Sprinkle shrimp with salt, and divide between two 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bags. Arrange shrimp in single layer and seal bags, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bags into prepared water bath, weight bags until shrimp are fully submerged, then clip top corner of each bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for at least 45 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, fill large bowl halfway with ice and water. Transfer zipper-lock bags to prepared ice bath and let sit until chilled, about 15 minutes. Transfer shrimp to colander and peel, leaving tails intact; discard shrimp shells.

For the Cocktail Sauce: Whisk all ingredients in bowl until combined. Serve shrimp with sauce.

To Make Ahead: Cooked and chilled shrimp and cocktail sauce can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.

## Notes

I purchased Costco 9/4 count shrimp. I also was lazy and used store-bought cocktail sauce.  These were delicious and very, very, easy. Need to be a bit more careful when shelling.
