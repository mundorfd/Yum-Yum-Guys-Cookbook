# Gyros

## Ingredients

- 1 egg lightly beaten
- 6 garlic cloves minced
- 3 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1 lb. ground lamb
- 1 lb. ground turkey or beef

## Tzatziki Sauce

- 1 cup (8 ounces) plain yogurt
- 1 medium cucumber peeled, seeded and chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

## Gyros

- 8 whole pita breads
- 3 tablespoons olive oil divided
- 16 slices tomato
- 8 slices sweet onion halved

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the egg, garlic, oregano, kosher salt and pepper. Crumble lamb and beef over mixture; mix well.
2. Pat into an ungreased 9-in. x 5-in. loaf pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350° for 60-70 minutes or until no pink remains and a meat thermometer reads 160°. Cool completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours.
3. For sauce, in a small bowl, combine the yogurt, cucumber, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
4. Brush pita breads with 1 tablespoon oil; heat on a lightly greased griddle for 1 minute on each side. Keep warm. Cut meat loaf into very thin slices. In a large skillet, fry meat loaf in remaining oil in batches until crisp.
5. On each pita bread, layer the tomato, onion and meat loaf slices; top with some tzatziki sauce. Carefully fold pitas in half. Serve with remaining sauce. 

## Notes

Delicious!
