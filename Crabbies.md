# Crabbies

## Ingredients

- ¼ cup margarine, softened
- ⅔ (5 ounce) container sharp processed cheese spread (Old English)
- 8 ounces cooked crabmeat
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- 8 English muffins, split

## Directions

Preheat oven on broiler setting.

In a medium bowl, mix together margarine and cheese spread. Stir in crabmeat, mayonnaise, garlic powder, and parsley. Spread the mixture on the split English muffins. Arrange on a cookie sheet.

Broil until the cheese mixture is bubbly.

## Notes

Tim's specialty! He quarters the english muffins after assembling them and freezes individual bites. He's made the often, and I haven't found anyone that doesn't love them.
