# Oven-Roasted Chicken Thighs

## Ingredients

- 8 (6- to 8-ounce) bone-in, skin on, chicken thighs trimmed
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- Pepper
- Vegetable oil spray
- 1 recipe sauce optional (related)

## Directions

1. Adjust oven racks to middle and lowest positions, place rimmed baking sheet on lower rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Using metal skewer, poke skin side of chicken thighs 10 to 12 times. Season both sides of thighs with salt and pepper; spray skin lightly with vegetable oil spray. Place thighs skin side down on preheated baking sheet. Return baking sheet to bottom rack. If preparing sauce (see related recipes), place foil packet on middle rack.
3. Roast chicken until skin side is beginning to brown and meat registers 160 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating pan and, if preparing sauce, removing foil packet after 10 minutes. Remove chicken from oven and heat broiler.
4. While broiler heats, flip chicken skin side up. Broil chicken on middle rack until skin is crisp and well browned and meat registers 175 degrees, about 5 minutes, rotating pan as needed for even browning. Transfer chicken to platter and let rest for 5 minutes.
5. While chicken is resting, finish sauce, if using. Serve chicken, passing sauce separately. 

## Notes

For best results, trim all visible fat from the thighs. Use a heavy-duty baking sheet and fully preheat the oven and baking sheet before adding the chicken. The chicken can be served plain or with any of the related recipes.
