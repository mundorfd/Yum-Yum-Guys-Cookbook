## Ingredients

- 2 large juice oranges, 1 cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices, 1 juiced
- 1 large lemon, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
- Â¼ cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons Triple Sec
- 1 (750-ml.) bottle fruity white wine (medium-bodied), chilled (see above note)
- 6 - 8 ice cubes

## Directions

1. Add orange and lemon slices and sugar to large pitcher; mash gently with wooden spoon until sugar dissolves and fruit releases some juice but is not completely crushed, about 1 minute. Stir in orange juice, Triple Sec, and wine; refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 8 hours.
2. Before serving, add ice cubes and stir briskly to redistribute settled fruit and pulp; serve immediately.

## Notes

The longer sangria sits before drinking, the more smooth and mellow it will taste. A full day is best, but if that's impossible, give it an absolute minimum of 2 hours to sit. Use large, heavy, juicy oranges and lemons for the best flavor. Doubling or tripling the recipe is fine, but you'll have to switch to a large punch bowl in place of the pitcher. A Pinot Grigio or an un-oaked Chardonnay are the best choices for this recipe.
